# 相机协议

相机通讯协议用于远程配置机载相机或查询相机的状态。 它支持照片拍摄、视频捕获和流媒体。 它还提供了查询并配置机载相机存储空间的消息。

> **Tip** 软件 [Dronecode Camera Manager](https://camera-manager.dronecode.org/en/) 实现了该协议。

## 相机连接

相机组件的须按照 [Heartbeat/Connection Protocol](../services/heartbeat.md) 的要求，发送固定频率的心跳包 (一般可取 1Hz)。 每个相机组件都必须独占一个预设的ID：从 [MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA](../messages/common.md#MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA) 到 [MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA6](../messages/common.md#MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA6)。

当首次检测到一个新相机组件的心跳时，GCS (或其它接收系统) 应立刻启动 [Camera Identification](#camera_identification) 程序。

> **Note** 如果某个相机的心跳中断，接收系统将认为该相机组件 *disconnected*，并将其从可用相机列表中删除。 如果再次检测到该相机的心跳，必须重新运行一次 *camera identification* 程序。

## 相机基本操作

标志位 [CAMERA_INFORMATION.flags](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_INFORMATION) 提供了相机能力的相关信息。 It contains a bitmap of [CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS) values that tell the GCS if the camera supports still image capture, video capture, or video streaming, and if it needs to be in a certain mode for capture, etc.

### Camera Identification {#camera_identification}

The camera identification operation determines what cameras are available/exist (this is carried out before all other operations).

The first time a heartbeat is received from a camera component the GCS will send the camera a [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION) message. The camera component will then respond with the a [COMMAND_ACK](../messages/common.md#COMMAND_ACK) message containing a result. On success (result is [MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED](../messages/common.md#MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED)) the camera component must then send a [CAMERA_INFORMATION](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_INFORMATION) message.

{% mermaid %} sequenceDiagram; participant GCS participant Camera Camera->>GCS: HEARTBEAT \[cmp id: MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA\] (first) GCS->>Camera: MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION GCS->>GCS: Start timeout Camera->>GCS: COMMAND_ACK Note over Camera,GCS: If MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED send info. Camera->>GCS: CAMERA_INFORMATION {% endmermaid %}

The operation follows the normal [Command Protocol](../services/command.md) rules for command/acknowledgment (if no `COMMAND_ACK` response is received for `MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION` the command will be re-sent a number of times before failing). If `CAMERA_INFORMATION` is not received after receiving an ACK with `MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED`, the protocol assumes the message was lost, and the cycle of sending `MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION` is repeated. If `CAMERA_INFORMATION` is still not received after three cycle repeats, the GCS may assume that the camera is not supported.

The `CAMERA_INFORMATION` response contains the bare minimum information about the camera and what it can or cannot do. This is sufficient for basic image and/or video capture.

If a camera provides finer control over its settings `CAMERA_INFORMATION.cam_definition_uri` will include a URI to a [Camera Definition File](../services/camera_def.md). If this URI exists, the GCS will request it (using a standard HTTP GET request), parse it and prepare the UI for the user to control the camera settings. The definition file can be *hosted* anywhere.

> **Note** If the camera component provides an HTTP interface, the definition file can be hosted on the camera itself. Otherwise, it can be hosted by any regular, reachable server.

The `CAMERA_INFORMATION.cam_definition_version` field should provide a version for the definition file, allowing the GCS to cache it. Once downloaded, it would only be requested again if the version number changes.

If a vehicle has more than one camera, each camera will have a different component ID and send its own heartbeat. The GCS should create multiple instances of a camera controller based on the component ID of each camera. All commands are sent to a specific camera by addressing the command to a specific component ID.

### Camera Modes

Some cameras must be in a certain mode for still and/or video capture.

The GCS can determine if it needs to make sure the camera is in the proper mode prior to sending a start capture (image or video) command by checking whether the [CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_MODES](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_MODES) bit is set true in [CAMERA_INFORMATION.flags](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_INFORMATION).

In addition, some cameras can capture images in any mode but with different resolutions. For example, a 20 megapixel camera would take a full resolution image when set to `CAMERA_MODE_IMAGE` but only at the current video resolution if it is set to `CAMERA_MODE_VIDEO`.

To get the current mode, the GCS would send a [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_SETTINGS](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_SETTINGS) command. The camera component will then respond with the a [COMMAND_ACK](../messages/common.md#COMMAND_ACK) message containing a result. On success (`COMMAND_ACK.result` is [MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED](../messages/common.md#MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED)) the camera must then send a [CAMERA_SETTINGS](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_SETTINGS) message. The current mode is the `CAMERA_SETTINGS.mode_id` field.

The sequence is shown below:

{% mermaid %} sequenceDiagram; participant GCS participant Camera GCS->>Camera: MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_SETTINGS GCS->>GCS: Start timeout Camera->>GCS: COMMAND_ACK Note over Camera,GCS: If MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED send info. Camera->>GCS: CAMERA_SETTINGS {% endmermaid %}

> **Note** Command acknowledgment and message resending is handled in the same way as for [camera identification](#camera_identification) (if a successful ACK is received the camera will expect the `CAMERA_SETTINGS` message, and repeat the cycle - up to 3 times - until it is received).

To set the camera to a specific mode, the GCS would send the [MAV_CMD_SET_CAMERA_MODE](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_SET_CAMERA_MODE) command with the appropriate mode.

The sequence is shown below:

{% mermaid %} sequenceDiagram; participant GCS participant Camera GCS->>Camera: MAV_CMD_SET_CAMERA_MODE GCS->>GCS: Start timeout Camera->>GCS: COMMAND_ACK Note over Camera,GCS: If MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED, mode was changed. {% endmermaid %}

> **Note** The operation follows the normal [Command Protocol](../services/command.md) rules for command/acknowledgment.

### Storage Status

Before capturing images and/or videos, a GCS should query the storage status to determine if the camera has enough free space for these operations (and provide the user with feedback as to the current storage status). The GCS will send the [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_STORAGE_INFORMATION](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_STORAGE_INFORMATION) command and it expects a [STORAGE_INFORMATION](../messages/common.md#STORAGE_INFORMATION) response. For formatting (or erasing depending on your implementation), the GCS will send a [MAV_CMD_STORAGE_FORMAT](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_STORAGE_FORMAT) command.

### Camera Capture Status

In addition to querying about storage status, the GCS will also request the current *Camera Capture Status* in order to provide the user with proper UI indicators. The GCS will send a [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS) command and it expects a [CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS) response.

### Still Image Capture

A camera supports still image capture if the [CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_CAPTURE_IMAGE](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_CAPTURE_IMAGE) bit is set in [CAMERA_INFORMATION.flags](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_INFORMATION).

To capture an image, the GCS uses the [MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE) command. Each time an image is captured, a [CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED) message is sent back to the GCS.

The `CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED` message not only tells the GCS the image was captured, it is also intended for geo-tagging.

The capture command can be used to request one single image capture or a time lapse. If the command is set to take more than one single image, the GCS might use the [MAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE) command to stop it.

### Video Capture

A camera supports video capture if the [CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_CAPTURE_VIDEO](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_CAPTURE_VIDEO) bit is set in [CAMERA_INFORMATION.flags](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_INFORMATION).

To start recording videos, the GCS uses the [MAV_CMD_VIDEO_START_CAPTURE](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_VIDEO_START_CAPTURE) command. If requested, the [CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS](#camera_capture_status) message is sent to the GCS at a set interval.

To stop recording, the GCS uses the [MAV_CMD_VIDEO_STOP_CAPTURE](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_VIDEO_STOP_CAPTURE) command.

### Video Streaming

A camera is capable of streaming video if it sets the [CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_VIDEO_STREAM](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_VIDEO_STREAM) bit set in [CAMERA_INFORMATION.flags](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_INFORMATION).

When the GCS receives the [CAMERA_INFORMATION](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_INFORMATION) message and it detects the [CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_VIDEO_STREAM](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_VIDEO_STREAM) flag, it will then send the [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION) message to the camera requesting the video streaming configuration. In response, the camera returns a [VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION](../messages/common.md#VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION) message for each stream it supports.

> **Note** If your camera only provides video streaming and nothing else (no camera features), the [CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_VIDEO_STREAM](../messages/common.md#CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_VIDEO_STREAM) flag is the only flag you need to set. The GCS will then provide video streaming support and skip camera control.
