# MAVLink Developer Guide

[![Slack](https://px4-slack.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](http://slack.px4.io)

MAVLink is a very lightweight, header-only message marshalling library for micro air vehicles / drones.

MAVLink follows a modern hybrid publish-subscribe and point-to-point design pattern: Data streams are sent / published as **topics** while configuration sub-protocols such as the [mission protocol](protocol/mission.md) or [parameter protocol](protocol/parameter.md) are point-to-point with retransmission.

Messages are [defined within XML files](messages/README.md), which may then be converted into appropriate source code for each of the [supported languages](#supported_languages). Each XML file defines the message set supported by a particular system, also referred to as a "dialect". The reference message set that is implemented by most ground control stations and autopilots is defined in [common.xml](messages/common.md) (most dialects build on this definition).

> **Tip** Because MAVLink doesn't require any additional framing it is very well suited for applications with very limited communication bandwidth. It's reference implementation in C is highly optimized for resource-constrained systems with limited RAM and flash memory. It is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers.

MAVLink was first released early 2009 by Lorenz Meier and has now a [significant number of contributors](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/graphs/contributors).
