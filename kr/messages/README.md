# Message Definitions

MAVLink messages are defined in an [XML file](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml). This XML file is located in the [message definition](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/) repository. Only messages contained in this file are considered standard messages.

The standard messages are provided as a human-readable table: [Common](../messages/common.md).
