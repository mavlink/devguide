# Contributing to MAVLink

We follow the [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) development model.

Contributions are divided into several categories:

* Complicated changes that require significant review should be initiated using an RFC pull request in [mavlink/rfcs](https://github.com/mavlink/rfcs). This is primarily intended for new microservice interface definitions, as these require discussion of both messages and message sequences (state machines) \(examples: parameter or mission protocol\). Depending on the scope of the change, it may also be required when *modifying* a microservice.
* Less complex changes should be submitted as a PRs to the [mavlink/mavlink](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink) repository. This includes message additions/changes that do not affect a state machine.
* Changes to mavgen generator code should be submitted as PRs to the [ArduPilot/Pymavlink](https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink) repository.

The sections below explain how to contribute to each category and how to raise a pull request.

## How to Contribute Complex Changes

* Open a pull request against the RFC repository containing a new RFC number <https://github.com/mavlink/rfcs> and use the template in the 0000 RFC.
* Reach out to the community on Slack and the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mavlink) to raise awareness
* Address concerns by pushing more commits to the pull request

## How to Contribute Simple Changes

* Open a pull request against the specification repository: <https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink>
* Reach out to the community on Slack and the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mavlink) to raise awareness
* Address concerns by pushing more commits to the pull request

## How to Open a Pull Request

1. First [fork and clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the project project.
2. Create a feature branch off master
    
        git checkout -b mydescriptivebranchname
        
    
    > **Note** *Always* branch off master for new features.

3. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.

* Include context information, what was fixed, and an [issue number](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink) \(Github will link these then conveniently\)
* **Example:**
    
    ``` Change the attitude output spec documentation
    
    * Fixes a typo
    * Clarifies that units are radians
        
        Fixes issue #123 ```

4. Test your changes \(we may ask you for test results in your PR\).

5. Push changes to your repo:
    
        git push origin mydescriptivebranchname
        

6. Send a [pull request](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/compare/) to merge changes in the branch.
